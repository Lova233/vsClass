# AUTOCLASS extension for ❤️ VSCode

Auto class is a VS code extension that aim to generate style rules from HTML docs.

## Features

The project is still under Development, if you like to contribute plese contact me @ andrealovati.cube3@gmail.com

Current Features

### Create Single Class :
Use this command to transcript the selected class to the relative stylesheet ( to be defined what is the "relative stylesheet"). Ideally would be great some sort of Hover activation. In this stage this works by selecting a class and run the command ```ctrt``` + ```shift``` + ```p``` and select "Create Single Class"

### Create All Class :
Use this command to transcript all the selected class to the relative stylesheet ( relative what? look above).
Either for this command would be great some sort of Hover activation. In this stage this works by selecting the entire HTML page and run the command ```ctrt``` + ```shift``` + ```p```  and select "Create All Class"

### Create All NEW Class :
Use this command to transcript all the selected NEW (this means that the extension will omit the opening of prexistent class in the stylesheet ) class to the relative stylesheet ( relative what? look above).
Either for this command would be great some sort of Hover activation. In this stage this works by selecting the entire HTML page and run the command ```ctrt``` + ```shift``` + ```p```  and select "Create All NEW Class"

(ATM I'am using this command to test user input so this is not working as expected!)
